******* Inheritance vs. Composition *******

=> Inheritance : drives Object Oriented programming. Classes, Sub-Classes, creating objects/instances from those classes and inheriting 
                 traits from those classes
                 - design your types around what they are

=> Composition : a way to compose you code structure by pulling together bits and pieces you need
                 - design your types around what they do

For React applications === Composition over Inheritance


******* React Code Use Patterns *******
    1. Components with props
         ~ base unit for code reuse in React 
         ~ like a function you can call over and over again
         ~ can make components more reuseable => instead of hard coding data you can pass in props and depending on the props passed in 
            can render things differently

    2. Children 
          ~ If you want the person using your component to have full control over what is being diplayed inside the comonent
         
    3. Higher-Order Components
          ~ A function that takes a component as its first argument and returns a new component that wraps the given component, providing
            extra capabilities to it. 
          ~ ex. export default withToggle(Component)

    4. Render Props
          ~ 
    
    ** both Higher-Order Components and Render Props became outdated with introduction of Hooks **


******* React Tree Rendering *******

=> React recursively renders components down one branch until there is no more to render 
      - a child component that has two grandchild components, will render BOTH of its grandchild components before its parent goes on to 
        render the next child(its sibling)

=> Changes to state or props in any component will recursively re-render down the remaining tree whether the those components have changed or not
      - the component with the state change re-renders as well as all the its child and grandchild components
      - the more components that have to re-render after state change the more performance decreases
      - shouldComponentUpdate(), React.PureComponent, and React.memo() are tools to help fix this problem
