**************** Context ****************

// Context Provider //
=> this is the parent component to the Conext Consumer components.
    - uses the createContext() method which gives and object for Provider and Consumer
    - the provider component will then be wrapped in the provider tags 
    * must pass a value prop to the provider => this is whatever data you are trying to save

// ContextType //
=> only works in class components
    - there isn't a way to pass down a method to change the context 
    - access context using this.context

// Context Consumer //
=> uses a render prop that is going to be injected to the children elements betweeen the opening and closing 
   Consumer component tags 
   - need to provide a function and when you call it, call it with the context. This function will return the elements 
     you want to have access to that context
   * for functional components
